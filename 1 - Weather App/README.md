# Info

This is a basic application for seeing the weather forecast in cities around the world.

The application was made using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeather API</a>.

# How It Works

To use the application, you must create an OpenWeather account to be able to obtain an API key for the application to work.

After getting the API key, you must place it inside the "APIKey" variable within the "index.js" file.

You will see this variable right at the beginning of the file, and it will have this string "Your API key goes here", you must replace it with your API key.

Comments:

So when the layout was created, I had no idea that to have some of the features that were in the layout, I would have to pay.

So when developing the application I had to improvise, which is why the application layout is a little different from the figma layout.
